description: 'Cystic Fibrosis, or CF, is a genetic disease that affects the exocrine glands. These glands control the production of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. Cystic Fibrosis causes the body to produce thick mucus that blocks airways, prevents normal digestive functions, and leads to bacterial infections.'
